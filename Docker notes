Docker:
*******

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that
use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages 
called containers.Containers are isolated from one another and 
bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; 
they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are 
thus more lightweight than virtual machines.


Purpose of Docker:
******************

The main purpose of Docker is to Deploy applications to production
environment, or other environments as required by Ops. 
However, the highlight of Docker lies in the process of deploying it.

DockerFile:
***********

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user
could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build
users can create an automated build that executes several command-line 
instructions in succession.
